## ðŸ“„ Coding Guidelines

Write clean, simple C in the style of cut, sort, uniq.
Avoid dynamic memory if possible.
Prefer small, modular functions.
Use standard C89/C99 and POSIX headers.
Donâ€™t use third-party dependencies (pure libc).
Keep CLI behavior consistent with Unix philosophy: composable, pipeable, quiet by default.

Add test cases for any new functionality in tests/.
If possible, include input and expected output files:
tests/mycase.in
